You might be use to learning basic HTML and CSS from your web design class. Once you make the move towards more advanced front-end development you may start to notice a thing called preprocessed CSS. Preprocessed CSS is such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html">SCSS</a>, <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> are all eventually converted (known as compiling) to normal (vanilla) CSS so the browser can style the page correctly.

Each project detail pages, as you might expect, gives more in-depth information about the project. I usually describe the general overview, hightlight some of the challenging areas of the project, describe other important design decisions, and explain the role(s) I played. If the project is a website, a button to the live site precedes the last paragraph of the project detail, for quick access.
